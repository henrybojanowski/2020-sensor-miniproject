Introduction and Summary

As requested on September 8, 2020, we ran a simulation of various sensors for temperature, occupancy, and CO2 in three different rooms, Lab 1, Class 1, and Office 1. Upon running the client for the sensors, the first greeting string issued by the server was &quot;ECE Senior Capstone IoT Simulator&quot;. After collecting the JSON data to a text file, the Lab 1 room was chosen for sensor data analysis. After parsing through 133 temperature values from the room, the median temperature value was calculated to be around 20.98 degrees Celsius, and the temperature variance was calculated to be roughly 51.61 degrees Celsius squared. Calculations on the 133 occupancy data values in the same room resulted in a median occupancy of 45 people and a occupancy variance of roughly 4.68 people squared. The data histogram for each sensor type can be seen attached below in Figure 1. Additionally, after analyzing all the time intervals between sensor readings across all rooms, the mean time interval was calculated to be \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ and with a variance of \_\_\_\_\_. The histogram for these time intervals can be seen in Figure 2. The time interval distribution mimics \_\_\_\_\_\_\_.

**Figure 1**

After computing relatively large variances for sensor data, especially for temperature readings, an algorithm was created to detect data anomalies. The algorithm was set up to cutoff temperature readings above \_\_\_ and below \_\_\_\_. The percent of &quot;bad&quot; data points taken from room \_\_\_\_\_\_ was \_\_. With these erroneous temperature readings from \_\_\_\_\_\_ discarded, the new median was \_\_\_\_\_ and the new variance was \_\_\_\_\_\_\_. The possible bounds on temperature for each room type were determined as follows: \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_. It should be important to note that a persistent change in temperature doesn&#39;t necessarily indicate a failed sensor. Possible explanations could be malfunctions in the room&#39;s thermostat or HVAC system. The temperature regulation could be broken, resulting in the air conditioning continually decreasing the temperature, or the heater continually increasing the temperature. A less realistic, although plausible explanation could be a large scale building fire, which could cause consistent increases in temperature readings.

Conclusion

This simulation is reflective of the real world in that there are faulty sensor readings dispersed among actual sensor readings. This models how sensor noise and other unavoidable issues may result in issues that cause bad sensor readings. Additionally, the need to implement an error checking system on sensor readings is quite realistic as they are also used in actual sensor applications. Another real aspect of the simulation was the useful data collected, temperature, CO2 levels, and occupancy are all necessary to meet OSHA building guidelines for temperature, CO2 ppm levels, and occupancy. On the other hand, the simulation&#39;s sensor reading intervals are quite unrealistic. For normal sized rooms, temperatures, CO2 levels, and occupancy, don&#39;t fluctuate so much over the span of a few seconds. It is understandable that these simulated short intervals where meant to allow for many sensor readings for data analysis, but in the real world the time interval would be significantly larger especially from an economic standpoint as consistent storage of relatively unimportant data every few seconds wouldn't make much sense. In this case with three different sensors types in three different rooms, it would make sense for the server to poll the sensors, as the number of sensors are relatively small. Furthermore, this would also allow the server to regularly troubleshoot sensor issues or detect and filter out erroneous data.

This sensor simulation completely utilized Python&#39;s web socket library. From the experience working with the Python simulation, it is clear that the servers and clients in said library focus on simplicity, which can allow for quick prototyping and easy collaboration between team members. Compiled language websockets are considerably more difficult to use, as the program needs to be constantly compiled prior to testing which is significantly harder to work on compared to Python&#39;s dynamic typing. Additionally, compiled languages are platform dependent, heavily tied to OS kernels, which may pose issues with program sharing in collaborative work such as this project.
